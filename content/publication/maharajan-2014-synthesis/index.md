abstract: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest on spinel ferrites for
  their remarkable versatile applications. Among AFe 2 O 4 , zinc ferrite (ZnFe 2
  O 4 ) has gained special importance due to its application in gas sensing, drug
  delivery and magnetic resonance imaging. Nanocrystalline powder of ZnFe 2 O 4 with
  average size of 25-30 nm was synthesized using citrate-gel method. Thermogravimetric
  analysis and XRD confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline ZnFe 2 O 4 at 400°C.
  The band appearing below 700 cm -1 in the FTIR spectrum confirmed the presence of
  Zn(Fe-O) group. Microstructural investigation was done on SEM and TEM. The response
  of ZnFe 2 O 4 towards alcohol and acetone vapour at 350°C was studied. The sample
  showed n-type conductivity with excellent vapour sensitivity. © 2014 The Indian
