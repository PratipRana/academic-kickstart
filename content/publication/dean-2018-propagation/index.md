abstract: Proteinaceous deposits composed of fibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) are the primary
  neuropathological hallmarks in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. The nucleation-dependent
  aggregation of Aβ is a stochastic process with frequently observed heterogeneity
  in aggregate size, structure, and conformation that manifests in fibril polymorphism.
  Emerging evidence indicates that polymorphic variations in Aβ fibrils contribute
  to phenotypic diversity and the rate of disease progression in AD. We recently demonstrated
  that a dodecamer strain derived from synthetic Aβ42 propagates to morphologically
  distinct fibrils and selectively induces cerebral amyloid angiopathy phenotype in
  transgenic mice. This report supports the growing contention that stable oligomer
  strains can influence phenotypic outcomes by faithful propagation of their structures.
  Although we determined the mechanism of dodecamer propagation on a mesoscopic scale,
  the molecular details of the microscopic reactions remained unknown. Here, we have
  dissected and evaluated individually the kinetics of macroscopic phases in aggregation
  to gain insight into the process of strain propagation. The bulk rates determined
  experimentally in each phase were used to build an ensemble kinetic simulation model,
  which confirmed our observation that dodecamer seeds initially grow by monomer addition
  toward the formation of a key intermediate. This is followed by conversion of the
  intermediate to fibrils by oligomer elongation and association mechanisms. Overall,
  this report reveals important insights into the molecular details of oligomer strain
  propagation involved in AD pathology.
