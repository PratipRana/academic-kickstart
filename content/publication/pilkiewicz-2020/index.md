abstract: As  manipulating  the  self-assembly  of  supramolecular  and  nanoscaleconstructs
  at the single-molecule level increasingly becomes the norm, new theo-retical scaffolds
  must be erected to replace the thermodynamic and kinetics basedmodels used to describe
  traditional bulk phase active syntheses. Like the statisticalmechanics underpinning
  these latter theories, the framework we propose uses stateprobabilities as its fundamental
  objects; but, contrary to the Gibbsian paradigm,our theory directly models the transition
  probabilities between the initial and finalstates of a trajectory, foregoing the
  need to assume ergodicity. We leverage theseprobabilities in the context of molecular
  self-assembly to compute the overall likeli-hood that a specified experimental condition
  leads to a desired structural outcome.We demonstrate the application of this framework
  to a simple toy model in whichNidentical  molecules  can  assemble  into  oligomers  of  different  lengths  and  con-clude
  with a discussion of how the high computational cost of such a fine-grainedmodel
  can be overcome through approximation when extending it to larger, morecomplex systems
