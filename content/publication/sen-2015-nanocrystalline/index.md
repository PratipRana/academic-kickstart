abstract: Abstract Nanocrystalline orthorhombic gallium ferrite (GFO) has been synthesized
  by a sol-gel method. The synthesized powder has been characterized by TG/DTA, XRD,
  TEM, FTIR and nitrogen adsorption isotherm. In the present study we report an excellent
  ethanol vapour sensitivity of nanocrystalline GaFeO<inf>3</inf> at concentrations
  down to 1 ppm making the sensors suitable for application in food industries. Interestingly
  in contrast to the market available consumers breath analyser based on tin dioxide,
  GaFeO<inf>3</inf>-based sensor is immune to moisture (present in breath) and acetone
  vapour (an interfacing agent for diabetics). Such gallium ferrite based sensors
  can be used to make potential interference free breath analyser for real-life applications.
  In addition, such sensors being highly selective and do not show any cross-sensitivity
  towards moisture, methanol and carbon monoxide like those based on tin dioxide.
