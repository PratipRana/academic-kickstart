abstract: In recent studies, miRNAs have been found to be extremely influential in
  many of  the essential biological processes. They exhibit a self-regulatory mechanism
  through which they act as positive/negative regulators of expression of genes and
  other miRNAs. This has direct implications in the regulation of various pathophysiological
  conditions, signaling pathways and different types of cancers. Studying miRNA-disease
  associations has been an extensive area of research; however deciphering miRNA-miRNA
  network regulatory patterns in several diseases remains a challenge. In this study,
  we use information diffusion theory to quantify the influence diffusion in a miRNA-miRNA
  regulation network across multiple disease categories. Our proposed methodology
  determines the critical disease specific miRNAs which play a causal role in their
  signaling cascade and hence may regulate disease progression. We extensively validate
  our framework using existing computational tools from the literature. Furthermore,
  we implement our framework on a comprehensive miRNA expression data set for alcohol
  dependence and identify the causal miRNAs for alcohol-dependency in patients which
  were validated by the phase-shift in their expression scores towards the early stages
  of the disease. Finally, our computational framework for identifying causal miRNAs
  implicated in diseases is available as a free online tool for the greater scientific
  community.
