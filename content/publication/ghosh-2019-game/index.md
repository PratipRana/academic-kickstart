abstract: Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is a significant event that underpins
  Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ aggregates, especially the low-molecular weight oligomers,
  are the primary toxic agents in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, there is increasing
  interest in understanding their formation and behaviour. In this paper, we use our
  previously established results on heterotypic interactions between Aβ and fatty
  acids (FAs) to investigate off-pathway aggregation under the control of FA concentrations
  to develop a mathematical framework that captures the mechanism. Our framework to
  define and simulate the competing on- and off-pathways of Aβ aggregation is based
  on the principles of game theory. Together with detailed simulations and biophysical
  experiments, our models describe the dynamics involved in the mechanisms of Aβ aggregation
  in the presence of FAs to adopt multiple pathways. Specifically, our reduced-order
  computations indicate that the emergence of off- or on-pathway aggregates are tightly
  controlled by a narrow set of rate constants, and one could alter such parameters
  to populate a particular oligomeric species. These models agree with the detailed
  simulations and experimental data on using FA as a heterotypic partner to modulate
  the temporal parameters. Predicting spatio-temporal landscape along competing pathways
  for a given heterotypic partner such as lipids is a first step towards simulating
  scenarios in which the generation of specific ‘conformer strains’ of Aβ could be
  predicted. This approach could be significant in deciphering the mechanisms of amyloid
  aggregation and strain generation, which are ubiquitously observed in many neurodegenerative
  diseases.
