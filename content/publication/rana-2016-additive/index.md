abstract: Copyright Â© 2016 ICST. Molecular communications is an emergent field of
  research that seeks to develop novel, nanoscale communications devices using design
  principles gleaned from studies of the topology and dynamic properties of biological
  signaling networks. To understand how these networks function as a whole, we must
  first identify and characterize the functional building blocks that compose them,
  and the best candidates for those are the topologically distinct subnetworks, or
  motifs, that appear in a statistically improbable abundance within these networks.
  In cellular transcriptional networks, one of the most prevalent motifs is the feed-forward
  loop, a three node motif wherein one top-level protein regulates the expression
  of a target gene either directly or indirectly through an intermediate regulator
  protein. Currently, no systematic effort has been made to treat an isolated feed-forward
  loop as a stand-Alone signal amplifying/attenuating device and understand its communication
  capacity in terms of the diffusion of individual molecules. To address this issue,
  in this paper we derive a theorem that estimates the upper and lower bounds of the
  channel capacity for a relay channel, which structurally corresponds to a feed-forward
  loop, by using an additive inverse Gaussian noise channel model of protein-ligand
  binding. Our results are just a first step towards assessing the performance bounds
  of simplified biological circuits in order to guide the development and optimization
  of synthetic, bio-inspired devices that can be used as information processing and
  forwarding units.
