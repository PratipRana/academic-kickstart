abstract: Achieving good sensitivity toward low ppm acetone with pronounced resolution
  is a challenging, yet very much required task for the development of breath analyzer
  to monitor diabetes in a non-invasive way. We were able to achieve high sensitivity,
  stability, ultrafast response toward sub-ppm acetone with a good resolution just
  by using MWCNTs as a substrate for nanocrystalline SnO2prepared through a facile
  sol-gel technique. The composites were well characterized using XRD and TEM/HRTEM
  which revealed not only the structure and purity of the samples but also indicates
  the successful integration of MWCNT with SnO2nanoparticles. The composite sensor
  showed much better performance at the lower temperature than pure SnO2. Enhancement
  of adsorption ability of SnO2due to the addition of MWCNTs, and the difference between
  their work function, could be collectively responsible for the improvement of sensing
  activity. Besides, these nanocomposite sensors also showed much-reduced cross-sensitivity
  toward moisture, which is a major component of human exhale breath. This will be
  an extra-advantage of MWCNT incorporation for developing breath analyzer to monitor
  diabetes using SnO2nanocomposites based sensor.
