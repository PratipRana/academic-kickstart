abstract: There has been an unprecedented generation of healthcare data at clinical
  practices. With the availability of advanced computing frameworks and the ability
  to electronically mine data from disparate sources (e.g. demographics, genetics,
  imaging, treatment, clinical decisions, and outcomes) big data research in medicine
  has become a very active field of interest. In this paper, we discuss the challenges
  associated with designing clinical decision support systems that try to leverage
  such disparate data sources and create smart healthcare tools to aid medical practitioners
  for better patient care and treatment plans. We next propose an integrated data
  curation, storage and analytics portal, called HINGE (the Health Information Gateway
  and Exchange application), that can effectively address many of the outstanding
  challenges in this domain. HINGE specifically caters to healthcare data from radiation
  oncology patients however, the underlying formalisms and principles, as discussed
  here, are readily extendible to other disease types making it an attractive tool
  for the design of next generation clinical decision support systems.
