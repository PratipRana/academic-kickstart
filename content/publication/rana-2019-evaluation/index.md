abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the most common
  neurodegenerative disorders related to aging. Though several risk factors are shared
  between these two diseases, the exact relationship between them is still unknown.
  In this paper, we analyzed how these two diseases relate to each other from the
  genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic viewpoints. Using an extensive literature
  mining, we first accumulated the list of genes from major genome-wide association
  (GWAS) studies. Based on these GWAS studies, we observed that only one gene (HLA-DRB5)
  was shared between AD and PD. A subsequent literature search identified a few other
  genes involved in these two diseases, among which SIRT1 seemed to be the most prominent
  one. While we listed all the miRNAs that have been previously reported for AD and
  PD separately, we found only 15 different miRNAs that were reported in both diseases.
  In order to get better insights, we predicted the gene co-expression network for
  both AD and PD using network analysis algorithms applied to two GEO datasets. The
  network analysis revealed six clusters of genes related to AD and four clusters
  of genes related to PD; however, there was very low functional similarity between
  these clusters, pointing to insignificant similarity between AD and PD even at the
  level of affected biological processes. Finally, we postulated the putative epigenetic
  regulator modules that are common to AD and PD.
