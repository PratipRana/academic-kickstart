abstract: 'Synthetic biologists endeavor to predict how the increasing complexity
  of multi-step signaling cascades impacts the fidelity of molecular signaling, whereby
  information about the cellular state is often transmitted with proteins that diffuse
  by a pseudo-one-dimensional stochastic process. This begs the question of how the
  cell leverages passive transport mechanisms to distinguish informative signals from
  the intrinsic noise of diffusion. We address this problem by using a one-dimensional
  drift-diffusion model to derive an approximate lower bound on the degree of facilitation
  needed to achieve single-bit informational efficiency in signaling cascades as a
  function of their length. Within the assumptions of our model, we find that a universal
  curve of the Shannon-Hartley form describes the information transmitted by a signaling
  chain of arbitrary length and depends upon only a small number of physically measur-able
  parameters. This enables our model to be used in conjunction with experimental measurements
  to aid in the selective design of biomolecular systems that can over-come noise
  to function reliably, even at the single-cell level.'
