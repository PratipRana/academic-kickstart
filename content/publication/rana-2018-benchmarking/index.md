abstract: 'Synthetic biologists endeavor to predict how the increasing complexity
  of multi-step signaling cascades impacts the fidelity of molecular signaling, whereby
  information about the cellular state is often transmitted with proteins that diffuse
  by a pseudo-one-dimensional stochastic process. This begs the question of how the
  cell leverages passive transport mechanisms to distinguish informative signals from
  the intrinsic noise of diffusion. We address this problem by using a one-dimensional
  drift-diffusion model to derive an approximate lower bound on the degree of facilitation
  needed to achieve single-bit informational efficiency in signaling cascades as a
  function of their length. Within the assumptions of our model, we find that a universal
  curve of the Shannon-Hartley form describes the information transmitted by a signaling
  chain of arbitrary length and depends upon only a small number of physically measur-able
  parameters. This enables our model to be used in conjunction with experimental measurements
  to aid in the selective design of biomolecular systems that can over-come noise
  to function reliably, even at the single-cell level. © 2018 Author(s). All article

  The field of synthetic biology has spurred the development of biotechnologies capable
  of inter-facing with the human body at the molecular level. From CRISPR/Cas9 gene
  drives that alter our genetic code 1 to proteins designed to modulate the sensitivity
  of molecular signaling cascades, 2,3 the state of the art has learned to imitate
  nature and, in so doing, surpass it. The cost of interfacing with biology at its
  most granular level, however, is that we must leverage fragile biomolecular components
  that transmit information far below the modern standards of electronic communications.
  For example, the transcriptional signaling pathways in a cell cannot reliably cross
  the minimal single-bit threshold required to distinguish meaningful signals from
  noise, 4 and coherent communication is only achieved when signaling is averaged
  over an entire cellular population. 4–6 Although some biological signaling does
  utilize electric currents, such as that in the human nervous system, 7 information
  transmitted at the cellular level is often accomplished via so-called molecular
  communication, in which discrete signaling molecules diffuse through an intervening
  liquid medium from a transmitting to a receiving site. 8,9 Because Brownian motion
  alone is slow and unreliable, many biological systems attempt to facilitate this
  diffusion with a variety of mechanisms, such as motor proteins that \" walk \" the
  molecules along cytoskeletal filaments, 10 transcription factors that locate their
  receiving site by sliding back and forth along the DNA contour, 11 and bacterial
  chemotaxis, in which molecules are carried by bacteria along a chemical gradient.
  12 These types of directed-diffusion processes typically exhibit a superdiffusive
  mean squared displacement that scales as t α , for 1 < α < 2, 13 and are often well
  approximated as one-dimensional stochastic processes a Electronic mail: Kevin.R.Pilkiewicz@usace.army.mil'
