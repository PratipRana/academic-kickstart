abstract: 'Self-templating propagation of protein aggregate conformations is increasingly
  becoming a significant factor in many neurological diseases. In Alzheimer disease
  (AD), intrinsically disordered amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides undergo aggregation that
  is sensitive to environmental conditions. High-molecular weight aggregates of Aβ
  that form insoluble fibrils are deposited as senile plaques in AD brains. However,
  low-molecular weight aggregates called soluble oligomers are known to be the primary
  toxic agents responsible for neuronal dysfunction. The aggregation process is highly
  stochastic involving both homotypic (Aβ-Aβ) and heterotypic (Aβ with interacting
  partners) interactions. Two of the important members of interacting partners are
  membrane lipids and surfactants, to which Aβ shows a perpetual association. Aβ–membrane
  interactions have been widely investigated for more than two decades, and this research
  has provided a wealth of information. Although this has greatly enriched our understanding,
  the objective of this review is to consolidate the information from the literature
  that collectively showcases the unique phenomenon of lipid-mediated Aβ oligomer
  generation, which has largely remained inconspicuous. This is especially important
  because Aβ aggregate “strains” are increasingly becoming relevant in light of the
  correlations between the structure of aggregates and AD phenotypes. Here, we will
  focus on aspects of Aβ-lipid interactions specifically from the context of how lipid
  modulation generates a wide variety of biophysically and biochemically distinct
  oligomer sub-types. This, we believe, will refocus our thinking on the influence
  of lipids and open new approaches in delineating the mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.
