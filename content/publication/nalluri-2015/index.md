abstract: Copyright is held by the author/owner(s). miRNAs (non-coding RNAs of âˆ¼20-22
  nt size) exhibit a self-regulatory mechanism through which they act as positive/negative
  regulators of expression of genes and other miRNAs. This has direct implications
  in the regulation of various signaling pathways and types of cancers. We use information
  diffusion theory to quantify inuence diffusion in a miRNA-miRNA regulation network
  across 'Carcinoma' diseases and determine critical miRNAs which play an influential
  role. We demonstrate that using this model, we can find important disease-specific
  miRNAs which tend to work closely. These results prove to be significant based on
  validation with previously established methods. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).
