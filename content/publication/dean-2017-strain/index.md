abstract: Low molecular weight oligomers of amyloid-β (Aβ) have emerged as the primary
  toxic agents in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). Polymorphism observed within
  the aggregation end products of fibrils are known to arise due to microstructural
  differences among the oligomers. Diversity in aggregate morphology correlates with
  the differences in AD, cementing the idea that conformational strains of oligomers
  could be significant in phenotypic outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative to determine
  the ability of strains to faithfully propagate their structure. Here we report fibril
  propagation of an Aβ42 dodecamer called large fatty acid-derived oligomers (LFAOs).
  The LFAO oligomeric strain selectively induces acute cerebral amyloid angiopathy
  (CAA) in neonatally-injected transgenic CRND8 mice. Propagation in-vitro occurs
  as a three-step process involving the association of LFAO units. LFAO-seeded fibrils
  possess distinct morphology made of repeating LFAO units that could be regenerated
  upon sonication. Overall, these data bring forth an important mechanistic perspective
  into strain-specific propagation of oligomers that has remained elusive thus far.
