abstract: Research that meaningfully integrates constraint-based modeling with machine
  learning is at its infancy but holds much promise. Here, we consider where machine
  learning has been implemented within the constraint-based modeling reconstruction
  framework and highlight the need to develop approaches that can identify meaningful
  features from large-scale data and connect them to biological mechanisms to establish
  causality to connect genotype to phenotype. We motivate the construction of iterative
  integrative schemes where machine learning can fine-tune the input constraints in
  a constraint-based model or contrarily, constraint-based model simulation results
  are analyzed by machine learning and reconciled with experimental data. This can
  iteratively refine a constraint-based model until there is consistency between experimental
  data, machine learning results, and constraint-based model simulations.
