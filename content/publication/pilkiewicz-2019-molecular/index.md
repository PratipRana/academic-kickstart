abstract: As manipulating the self-assembly of supramolecular and nanoscale constructs
  at the single-molecule level increasingly becomes the norm, new theoretical scaffolds
  must be erected to replace the thermodynamic and kinetics based models used to describe
  traditional bulk phase active syntheses. Like the statistical mechanics underpinning
  these latter theories, the framework we propose uses state probabilities as its
  fundamental objects; but, contrary to the Gibbsian paradigm, our theory directly
  models the transition probabilities between the initial and final states of a trajectory,
  foregoing the need to assume ergodicity. We leverage these probabilities in the
  context of molecular self-assembly to compute the overall likelihood that a specified
  experimental condition leads to a desired structural outcome. We demonstrate the
  application of this framework to a simple toy model in which three identical molecules
  can assemble in one of two ways and conclude with a discussion of how the high computational
  cost of such a fine-grained model can be overcome through approximation when extending
  it to larger, more complex systems.
