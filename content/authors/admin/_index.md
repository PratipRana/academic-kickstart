I'm a research assistant, working towards Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), focused in Computer Science from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). I work on massive data & complex biological problems to understand how gene activity regulates disease progression and disease heterogeneity. My expertise includes Data Science, Machine Learning, Algorithm, Mathematical Modeling, and Optimization. I am proficient in C/C++, R, Matlab, and Python. I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems.
